## AI Usage Log

AI was used as a learning and support tool

Examples of usage:

- Explaining JavaScript concepts such as optional chaining and destructuring
- Discussing safe handling of API responses (e.g. HTTP 204 responses)
- Brainstorming structure and documentation improvements
- How to handle dynamic routes like #/user/<username> in a simple hash router?
  The implementation was written and adapted manually to match the existing router and views. (18.02)
